# Basics of Navmeshing

Note: Sorry for the poor grammar and this is intended for newbies who've no idea what they're doing as far as Navmesh goes. 

## Introduction

There're two ways you can go about Navmeshing the cell. One way is to just autogen it.. The other is to Navmesh it yourself (manually). There're benefits to doing both despite the end result being mostly same-ish.



## Utilities of Navmeshing

### Preferred Pathing

This is really useful when you've auto-generated the Navmesh; as it still gives you control over where the NPC will path without having to spend a long amount of time Navmeshing it manually. So how do you do this? Hit CTRL+E to open Navmesh mode in the cell you desire. And then you should click on a triangle you've navmeshed as so:

If you did everything correctly you should simply press 'p' and it will make that triangle a preferred path. To make actual use of the preferred path you set out however, you'll need to check "Prefer Preferred Path?" in packages. 

## Water

Sometimes you'll want to navmesh over water to indicate swimming, for example. The way to do this is to navmesh normally and just select the triangle and hit the 'O' button. 

## Creating a Navmesh

### Manually

Find a good starting area for the cell you want to Navmesh and have the mode open (hotkey to open navmesh mode is CTRL+E). Then simply hold control and left click three times against broad areas as so:

 You can continue working off that triangle or make a new one and later connect it. Personally I find it easier to work off of an existing triangle and just make new ones when I've too. If when working you find your triangle getting too small you can left click on the edge of a triangle (while holding control). If you click long enough away from the other 

#### Working with open word cells

Kind of needs a subsection of its own. Essentially you'll run into an issue when navmeshing in Open world cells that you can't navmesh to a cell nearby. What you'll want to do is drag the edge of the navmesh as far as you can to the invisible border and then line up the vertices. An example of this:

> Hide contents

After lining it up correctly you'll want to finalize your navmesh (Hotkey: CTRL+F1) if you lined up correctly the border of the cells will have green lines like this: 

> Hide contents
>
> ![Xz4l409.png](http://i.imgur.com/Xz4l409.png)

The green lines show that an NPC can make passage between the two cells navmeshes. You also should finalize the navmesh in every cell you're working in. 
That about covers the basics of manually navmeshing..
Authors Note: 
I did mention that you can create new triangles instead of working off of the one you initially created; which is true. But for the Navmesh to work they need to eventually connect. 

### Auto-Generating Navmeshing

If you wish to get it done quickly just hit CTRL+E, then click Navmesh on the top toolbar, Then Generation, Recast and finally on the new window that popped up hit "include landscapes" and select okay. Then Navmesh will be generated by your computer. You'll need to do this in every cell you want to Navmesh in.

That about covers it.. Any questions or feedback could be put below.
